# Human-Resources-data---EDA-and-Machine-Learning

In this project, I practised Data visualization through Exploratory Data analysis using functions like Group by. I plotted Histograms, Bar plots, Box plots, Pie charts and Correlation Heatmap.

In the Machine learning part, I did Clustering. But before that, I did data Wrangling through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is used for dimensionality Reduction, when  the dataset too many columns.

K-means was performed where the number of clusters was determined using the Elbow mwthod.

PCA is useful in HR analytics when you have many correlated variables and want to condense them into fewer, interpretable dimensions without losing much information. A common example is employee surveys: instead of analyzing 30–40 individual Likert-scale questions, PCA can reduce them into broader factors like job satisfaction, engagement, or workplace culture. This not only simplifies reporting but also reduces noise and multicollinearity in predictive models.

It’s also appropriate for exploratory analysis when the goal is to identify hidden patterns, such as grouping related performance indicators, training outcomes, or well-being measures. However, PCA is most effective when variables are continuous, moderately correlated, and measured on similar scales—otherwise the reduction may not be meaningful.

In HR contexts, PCA works best to summarize complex datasets (e.g., surveys, performance metrics, engagement indices) into a smaller set of interpretable dimensions that can then be used for clustering employees, predicting turnover, or tracking cultural shifts over time.
