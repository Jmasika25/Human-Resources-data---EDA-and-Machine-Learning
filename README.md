# Human-Resources-data---EDA-and-Machine-Learning

In this project, I practised Data visualization through Exploratory Data analysis using functions like Group by. I plotted Histograms, Bar plots, Box plots, Pie charts and Correlation Heatmap.

In the Machine learning part, I did Clustering. But before that, I did data Wrangling through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is used for dimensionality Reduction, when  the dataset too many columns.

K-means was performed where the number of clusters was determined using the Elbow mwthod.
